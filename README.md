# IoT Anomaly Detection Project

## Overview

The **IoT Anomaly Detection Project** is designed to monitor data collected from Internet of Things (IoT) devices and detect abnormal patterns or outliers. The project uses real-time data sent by sensors and leverages machine learning algorithms to automatically identify anomalies. This system provides efficient maintenance management and can send early alerts when issues are detected, ensuring smoother operations and quicker responses to potential problems.

## Features

- Real-time data monitoring from IoT devices
- Anomaly detection using machine learning algorithms
- Automatic alerts when abnormal behavior is detected
- Efficient maintenance management
- Early problem detection to prevent larger issues

## Technologies Used

- IoT (Internet of Things)
- Machine Learning
- Sensors
- Real-time Data Processing

## Installation

To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iot-anomaly-detection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd iot-anomaly-detection
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the main application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Sensors connected to IoT devices collect real-time data.
2. **Data Analysis**: The data is processed and analyzed using machine learning models to identify patterns.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: The system learns the normal behavior of the data and detects when the data deviates from this normal behavior.
4. **Alert System**: If an anomaly is detected, the system automatically triggers an alert.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, the system will continuously monitor the incoming data from IoT devices. Whenever the system detects an anomaly, an alert will be generated to notify users about the issue.
